# v0.0.1-pre - 2013.03.22
Initial pre-release version

- Implement reload of ScrumDo board. Currently, a tab with the ScrumDo board 
  is set to reload every minute if the tab is active. If the tab is 
  re-activated after more than one minute has passed since the last view, a 
  reload is also triggered.
