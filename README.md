ScrumDo Trellic
===============

ScrumDo Trellic is a Google Chrome extension for the [ScrumDo](http://www.scrumdo.com) scrum board. It provides keyboard shortcuts similar to those found in [Trello](https://trello.com) to speed up interaction with the board.

Currently the project is buggy and incomplete, and ScrumDo has updated the design of their board since this was written.

To install the extension, open the Extensions window in Chrome and click 'Load unpacked extensionâ€¦'. In the file browser select the directory of this project.
